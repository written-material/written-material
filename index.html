		<b>FOURTH/Footnotes:</b> 
		Funny story: I named the shop "Written-Material" because my original idea, "Reading Material", was taken by a now-defunct MA area bike shop.
		Page colors: <a href="https://www.fosfarbase.org/~madelaine/" target="_blank">Madelaine Lavender.</a>
		I found out about <a href="http://contemporary-home-computing.org/" target="_blank">Prof. Dr. Style</a> from <a href="https://mindyseu.com/" target="_blank">Mindy Seu.</a>
		I got the idea to use Venmo from <a href="https://allmansright.com/" target="_blank">Allmansright.</a>
		I decided to start a bookstore/design studio because of the work that <a href="https://cactus.store/" target="_blank">Cactus Store</a> is doing.
		I wanted to do a low-tech website because of <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/" target="_blank"> Low-Tech Magazine</a> (solar powered verson coming soon!).
		Here is a <a href="profdr.zip">rough template</a> of this if you'd like to make your own!
