ON DIGITAL SPACES

As artists, we are often at the forefront of change, and with the relentless
advancement and adoption of technology, we should take some time to ask
questions.

This template is intended for use by artists who are interested in
gaining a better understanding of the digital systems that we use to promote,
share, or sell our work.

To that end, there are four distinct characteristics of this template:

1. It is written in only HTML and CSS.

2. It is a static website.

3. It encourages digital stewardship.

4. It opens the door for alternatives to large-scale corporate run website
building and hosting services; instead placing control firmly back into the
hands of the artist.

USE INSTRUCTIONS:

This template is designed so that you are able to add images and downloads,
swap links and text, and add pages easily. Suggested template pages are
labeled, as are extras.

I have taken care to clearly document this project, use simple and
straight-forward code, and have tried to leave as many comments as possible.
The goal is that you will be able to quickly build on this template as needed,
and customize it to your own personal needs.

I do request that you keep the "Digital Philosophy" page intact so that others
can be directed to the template as well.

I am ill equipped to provide an education in HTML or CSS. Here are some
resources that will help:

I host my webpage for free with GitHub, and I recommend that you do too.

You can set up a redirect for a custom domain!

Or, if you are so inclined, follow Chia Amisola's guide to hosting websites on google sheets.
