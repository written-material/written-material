written-material.net is an expansion of:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE STATIC SITE PROJECT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is, really, a small bookstore and graphic design studio. It is also a part of 
a larger project that looks to shift the paradigm of web design away from the ultra
responsive and resource intensive status quo. It exists within the growing movement 
of people who are shifting the internet back to the vernacular and a mindset of 
degrowth. Purchasing requires human connection and communication. The "Prof. Dr." 
style template is bare-bones and free to be copied, altered, and otherwise (mis)used.

It is both an e-commerce platform and a manifesto.
